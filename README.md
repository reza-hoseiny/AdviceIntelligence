We follow Test-driven development (TDD) that is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

the main entry for the test cases can be found in `test_tasks_unittest.py` file.
To run this file, run `python test_tasks_unittest.py -v` from the command line.
(or the -v swtich allows python to show which test cases are currently running with more details on the screen.
